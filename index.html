    <h1>WTAF? It's time for the wine industry to take an alternative approach to packaging</h1>
    <p>
      It is an open secret in the wine industry that the only way to make a significant step towards sustainability in wine is to move away from glass bottles. Until recently, there wasnâ€™t anything being done about it, so a group of like-minded wine brands have formed an alliance "Wine Traders For Alternative Formats" (WTAF) to tackle the issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group is on a mission to help reduce the carbon footprint of wine industry through eco-friendly innovations such as alternative format packaging, innovative recycling schemes, sustainably made wines, carbon life-cycle assessments and reforestation schemes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>WTAF</strong> founding members are BIB Wine, Canned Wine Co, Copper Crew, Graft Wine Company, More Wine and When in Rome Wine, a vanguard of the new wave of wine companies, who believe the biggest change they can make in wine is to reach for something other than a bottle.
